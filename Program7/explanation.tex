The model tells us that production is linear in time, or that the rate of production is constant, and that the number of viable sperm decays over time at some rate. This is modeled by the differential equation
\begin{eqnarray*}
    \dv{N}{t} = R - kN
\end{eqnarray*}

We use the Runge-Kutta method to solve the system. The following plots show the results of the simulations.
